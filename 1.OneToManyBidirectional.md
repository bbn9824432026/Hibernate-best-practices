**OntToManyBidirectional**

- Always cascade from parent to child.
- Use `mappedBy` on the child entity to define the relationship.
- Use `orphanRemoval` on the parent to remove children without references.
- Use helper methods on the parent to keep both sides of the association in sync.
- Use lazy fetching on both sides of the association.
- As entity identifiers, use assigned identifiers (business key, natural key, or `@NaturalId`) and/or database-generated identifiers. Properly override `equals()` and `hashCode()` methods (on the child side) as shown in the example.
- If `toString()` needs to be overridden, involve only basic attributes fetched when the entity is loaded from the database.
  
**Note:** Pay special attention to remove operations, particularly when removing child entities. `CascadeType.REMOVE` and `orphanRemoval=true` can generate excessive queries. In such scenarios, bulk operations are often the most efficient way to handle deletions.
