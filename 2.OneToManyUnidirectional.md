### Why You Should Avoid Unidirectional @OneToMany and Prefer Bidirectional @OneToMany Relationships

**Description**: As a rule of thumb, a unidirectional `@OneToMany` association is less efficient compared to a bidirectional `@OneToMany` or unidirectional `@ManyToOne` association. This application is a sample that demonstrates the DML (Data Manipulation Language) statements generated for read, write, and remove operations when the unidirectional `@OneToMany` mapping is used.

---

### Key Points:

- A regular unidirectional `@OneToMany` is less efficient than a bidirectional `@OneToMany` association.
- Using `@OrderColumn` comes with some optimizations for removal operations, but it is still less efficient than a bidirectional `@OneToMany` association.
- Using `@JoinColumn` eliminates the join (junction) table but remains less efficient than a bidirectional `@OneToMany` association.
- Using a `Set` instead of a `List`, or a bidirectional `@OneToMany` with `@JoinColumn` (e.g., `@ManyToOne @JoinColumn(name = "author_id", updatable = false, insertable = false)`) still performs worse than a bidirectional `@OneToMany` association.

### Code Example:

#### `Author` Entity (Unidirectional `@OneToMany` Example):

```java
@Entity
public class Author implements Serializable {

    private static final long serialVersionUID = 1L;

    @Id
    @GeneratedValue(strategy = GenerationType.IDENTITY)
    private Long id;

    private String name;
    private String genre;
    private int age;

    @OneToMany(cascade = CascadeType.ALL, orphanRemoval = true)
    @OrderColumn(name = "books_order")
    @JoinColumn(name = "author_id")  // Eliminates the junction table
    private List<Book> books = new ArrayList<>();

    // Helper methods
    public void addBook(Book book) {
        this.books.add(book);
    }

    public void removeBook(Book book) {
        this.books.remove(book);
    }

    public void removeBooks() {
        Iterator<Book> iterator = this.books.iterator();
        while (iterator.hasNext()) {
            Book book = iterator.next();
            iterator.remove();
        }
    }

    // Getters and Setters
    public Long getId() { return id; }
    public void setId(Long id) { this.id = id; }
    
    public String getName() { return name; }
    public void setName(String name) { this.name = name; }
    
    public String getGenre() { return genre; }
    public void setGenre(String genre) { this.genre = genre; }
    
    public int getAge() { return age; }
    public void setAge(int age) { this.age = age; }
    
    public List<Book> getBooks() { return books; }
    public void setBooks(List<Book> books) { this.books = books; }

    @Override
    public String toString() {
        return "Author{" + "id=" + id + ", name='" + name + '\'' +
               ", genre='" + genre + '\'' + ", age=" + age + '}';
    }
}
```

---

#### `Book` Entity:

```java
@Entity
public class Book implements Serializable {

    private static final long serialVersionUID = 1L;

    @Id
    @GeneratedValue(strategy = GenerationType.IDENTITY)
    private Long id;

    private String title;
    private String isbn;

    // Getters and Setters
    public Long getId() { return id; }
    public void setId(Long id) { this.id = id; }
    
    public String getTitle() { return title; }
    public void setTitle(String title) { this.title = title; }
    
    public String getIsbn() { return isbn; }
    public void setIsbn(String isbn) { this.isbn = isbn; }

    // Equality checks
    @Override
    public boolean equals(Object obj) {
        if (this == obj) return true;
        if (getClass() != obj.getClass()) return false;
        return id != null && id.equals(((Book) obj).id);
    }

    @Override
    public int hashCode() { return 2021; }

    @Override
    public String toString() {
        return "Book{" + "id=" + id + ", title='" + title + '\'' + ", isbn='" + isbn + '\'' + '}';
    }
}
```

#### `BookstoreService` Example:

```java
@Service
public class BookstoreService {

    private final AuthorRepository authorRepository;

    public BookstoreService(AuthorRepository authorRepository) {
        this.authorRepository = authorRepository;
    }

    @Transactional
    public void insertAuthorWithBooks() {
        Author jn = new Author();
        jn.setName("Joana Nimar");
        jn.setAge(34);
        jn.setGenre("History");

        Book jn01 = new Book();
        jn01.setIsbn("001-JN");
        jn01.setTitle("A History of Ancient Prague");

        Book jn02 = new Book();
        jn02.setIsbn("002-JN");
        jn02.setTitle("A People's History");

        Book jn03 = new Book();
        jn03.setIsbn("003-JN");
        jn03.setTitle("World History");

        jn.addBook(jn01);
        jn.addBook(jn02);
        jn.addBook(jn03);

        authorRepository.save(jn);
    }

    @Transactional
    public void insertNewBook() {
        Author author = authorRepository.fetchByName("Joana Nimar");

        Book book = new Book();
        book.setIsbn("004-JN");
        book.setTitle("History Details");

        author.addBook(book);  // Use addBook() helper method
        authorRepository.save(author);
    }

    @Transactional
    public void deleteLastBook() {
        Author author = authorRepository.fetchByName("Joana Nimar");
        List<Book> books = author.getBooks();
        author.removeBook(books.get(books.size() - 1));  // Remove the last book
    }

    @Transactional
    public void deleteFirstBook() {
        Author author = authorRepository.fetchByName("Joana Nimar");
        List<Book> books = author.getBooks();
        author.removeBook(books.get(0));  // Remove the first book
    }
}
```
